Overview 

The "Clone Netflix" project aims to create a replica of the Netflix landing page. 
This project will involve the development of an HTML document styled with CSS 
to resemble the layout and design of the Netflix homepage. The project will 
utilize HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling the elements to 
achieve the desired appearance. 

Project Components 
HTML Document: The project will include an HTML document containing the 
necessary markup for structuring the Netflix landing page. This document will 
define the layout, sections, and content structure of the page. 
CSS Stylesheet: A CSS stylesheet will be created to style the HTML elements 
according to the design specifications of the Netflix homepage. The stylesheet 
will define the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of various elements to 
replicate the appearance of the original page. 
Project Structure 
The project will be structured as follows: 
index.html: The main HTML document containing the structure of the Netflix 
landing page. 
style.css: The CSS stylesheet defining the styles for the HTML elements.
